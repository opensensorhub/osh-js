The difference between it and the normal pass-by-reference\n is that the side that transferred the data can no longer access it. In that case, the use of the data must be UNIQUE, that means\n you cannot use the data for anything else (like another viewer).\n The non transferable data is a copy of the data to be made before being sent to the worker.
